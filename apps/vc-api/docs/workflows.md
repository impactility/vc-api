# VC-API Workflows

## Overview of Workflows

This document defines workflows as a sequence of steps enabling interactions between parties (e.g., Holder, Issuer, Verifier) for Verifiable Credential (VC) issuance or verification processes. These workflows follow the guidelines established in [VC-API Workflows and Exchanges](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#workflows-and-exchanges).

Workflows allow developers to integrate and automate credential-related processes while maintaining compliance with standards like [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

## Credential Workflow Flows

### Workflow Configuration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Admin as Workflow Admin
    participant System as Workflow Management System
    actor Stakeholder as Stakeholder (Issuer/Verifier/Holder)
    
    Admin->>System: define the workflow template
    System->>Admin: confirm workflow configuration
    Admin->>Stakeholder: share workflow details
```

### Workflow Execution: Issuance/Verification
This sequence diagram illustrates the execution of a credential issuance or verification workflow. It includes all major interactions required for a successful VC operation.

```

## Workflow Definitions

To maintain a generic implementation for the VC-API, workflows are configured dynamically at runtime using Workflow Definitions. These definitions specify the steps, rules, and entities involved in the workflow.

### Workflow Definition Structure and Properties

#### Workflow Steps

The steps property of a Workflow Definition specifies the sequence of actions to be performed.

Supported step types include:

- Issuance Initiation: Collects data from the Holder to initiate credential issuance.
- Verification Request: Sends VC data for verification.
- Credential Review: Allows stakeholders to review and approve VC data.
- Credential Storage: Saves the VC in a Holder's wallet or storage.

#### Workflow Callbacks
Workflow Definitions can include callbacks to notify parties when specific events occur during the workflow. Callbacks consist of POST requests to the configured URLs.

Example scenarios for callbacks:

- Notification to Issuer upon successful credential issuance.
- Notification to Verifier upon completion of a verification process.


#### Workflow Interaction Types

Workflow interaction types are derived from the Interaction Types specification.

- Mediated Workflows: Include human or automated review steps for issuance or verification.
- Unmediated Workflows: Automatically process all interactions without external mediation.

## Workflow Examples

### Issuance Workflow Example

A mediated issuance workflow involves interactions between the Holder, Workflow Service, and Issuer. The Workflow Service coordinates the collection of Holder data, submission to the Issuer, and issuance of the VC.

Example Workflow Steps:

- Holder initiates issuance request via UI.
- Workflow collects Holder details (e.g., DID, attributes).
- Issuer validates data and issues VC.
- Workflow stores the VC in the Holderâ€™s wallet.

### Verification Workflow Example

An unmediated verification workflow involves direct submission of VC data to the Verifier.

Example Workflow Steps:

- Holder shares VC with Verifier.
- Workflow validates VC signatures and compliance.
- Workflow returns verification result to the Holder.
