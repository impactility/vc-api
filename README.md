# EWF and Elia Group Self-Sovereign-Identity (SSI) Wallet Components

[![CI](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ssi/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ssi/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Introduction
This repository provides a VC API implementation.

### Apps
#### VC-API
The [vc-api app](./apps/vc-api) is a NestJs implementation of the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/) [VC API Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api).

### Libraries
#### DID Library
The DID generation logic is encapsulated in the [did](./libraries/did) library.
This potentially allows the logic to be shared between wallets of various form-factors (e.g. nodejs wallet, a web wallet, another nodejs framework, etc in the future).

Often DID generation requires the generation of a new public-private keypair.
In order to rename agnostic to the key-generation and storage preferences of a particular wallet implementation, the [did](./libraries/did) DID factories accept public keys in the standard format of JWK.

An abstracted process of creating a DID controlled by a asymmetric key-pair is therefore:
```javascript
const key = generateKey(); // Generate a key pair and return the public key necessary to create the DID
const did = generateDID(key); // Code from ssi-did lib. Returns initial DID Document of DID, including Verification Methods
```

#### KMS Interface

## Technology Decisions

Architecture Decision Records are used to track technology and architecture decsions
(see [ADR 01](./apps/vc-api/docs/architecture/decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)).

The Architecture Decisions Records can be found [here](apps/vc-api/docs/architecture/decisions).

The [ADR Tools command line tool](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) can be used to add new ADRs.

## Installation
This repository is a monorepo that uses [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) with the PNPM package manager.

PNPM is used for its speed and solution to NPM doppelgangers (as well as being the default option for rush).
See comparison of [NPM vs PNPM vs Yarn for Rush](https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/package_managers/).

### Requirements

PNPM is required. See installation instructions here: https://pnpm.js.org/installation/

Rush is required. See installation instructions here: https://rushjs.io/pages/intro/get_started/

### Install

Use rush to install dependencies (not the package manager directly).
In other words, do not run `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
This is because [Rush optimizes](https://rushjs.io/pages/developer/new_developer/) by installing all of the dependency packages in a central folder, and then uses symlinks to create the “node_modules” folder for each of the projects.

```sh
$ rush install
```

### Build

Use rush to build.

```sh
$ rush build
```

## Testing
To run tests across all apps and libraries in one command, a rush script has been added to `./common/config/rush/command-line.json` 
``` sh
$ rush test
```
